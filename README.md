This site was made with Express.js, node.js and EJS. The idea was to test out EJS capabilities and generally learn the techniques involved. 

The future version will have the same site, exept it will be connected to a MongoDB database with Mongoose. 

Nothing fancy here. Just normal stuff. 

The gulpfile was merely a test and has nothing to do with this.
